(If you only intend on changing what armor they spawn with, ignore below and ONLY change
the item values inside of these tags)



These files are full armor sets and are not hardcoded at all,
you can add new sets or remove sets,
the only requirement is that the item to denote
which rank is assigned to the set stays the same
(the tacz_npc:rookie item for example, this is also the patch they drop on death)

If you add a new set or rename any set it will need to be added/changed in the loot table to work,
the loot table names are hardcoded, do not change them
